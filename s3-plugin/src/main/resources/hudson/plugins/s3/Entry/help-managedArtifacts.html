When enabled, this lets Jenkins fully manage the artifacts, exactly like it does when the artifacts
are published to the master.
<br>
In this case, the artifacts are stored in the "jobs/[job]/[build-number]/" path in the selected
bucket and prefix path. 

This means the following features are enabled:
<ul>
<li>artifacts are finger printed and linked to the build</li>
<li>artifacts can be downloaded directly from the build page in the 
S3 Artifact section</li>
<li>artifacts are automatically deleted when the build is deleted</li>
<li>the <em>S3 Copy Artifact</em> build step can be used to download artifacts from S3
automatically, helping build complex pipelines</li>
</ul>
</div>
